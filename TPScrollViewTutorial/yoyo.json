The shape and side face maintain General-Yoâ€™s traditional looks, but the profile is where the innovation lies.\n\nThe soft step-straight profile gives a smooth, luxurious feeling during play. For such a sharp profile, when compared to other contemporary yo-yos in the same size category, the Prestige comes in slightly lighter, making it a superbly speedy throw.\n\nCheck out the high quality PV below to get a feeling of where General-Yo is coming from. The Prestige comes with a String Lab Type X string. Enjoy!"

Once the Stealth Ogre hit the scene, Kasumi's team turned its luck around, and the Stealth Ogre was the engine that fueled its comeback."
