The shape and side face maintain General-Yo’s traditional looks, but the profile is where the innovation lies.\n\nThe soft step-straight profile gives a smooth, luxurious feeling during play. For such a sharp profile, when compared to other contemporary yo-yos in the same size category, the Prestige comes in slightly lighter, making it a superbly speedy throw.\n\nCheck out the high quality PV below to get a feeling of where General-Yo is coming from. The Prestige comes with a String Lab Type X string. Enjoy!"

The Free King has a wing profile and has a lot more traditional shape than some of their others like the Follow Wind or Immortal Star.  It uses the same thin silicone pad response system, which is common across most of Aoda's range and it can be siliconed if preferred.  It also has pointed hubs for matador play, these are quite sharp and effective if you like this style of play.  The hubs are also quite small so they don't get in the way when you do thumb grinds.  The finish is glossy so it's not the best yo-yo for finger grinds, it's okay and you can do them but it will slow down quite quickly.  Like the response it shares the same axle design as the other yo-yo's across their range although this one seems to be of the wider type, which is found in the Follow Wind.  Like their others it suffers from 'loose axle' syndrome, so have some Teflon Tape ready to patch things up when it starts getting loose."

The result is a wing shaped design based on the CODE 2 featuring a marbleized catch zone for superior grinds. The machined and anodized aluminum rings complete the weight distribution for long spins and the type of performance players have come to expect."
